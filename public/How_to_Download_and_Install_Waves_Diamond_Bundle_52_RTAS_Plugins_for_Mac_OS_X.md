Here are some tips and tricks to get the most out of Waves Diamond Bundle 5.2 RTAS plugins for Mac OS X.

- Use Q-Clone to capture the sound of any hardware equalizer and apply it to your audio tracks. Q-Clone lets you create custom EQ curves by sampling the frequency response of any external device. You can also use the Q-Clone library of presets to access the sound of classic analog EQs. To use Q-Clone, you need to connect the output of your hardware EQ to the input of your audio interface and vice versa. Then, insert Q-Clone on an audio track and click on Capture. This will record the EQ curve and store it in Q-Clone. You can then apply it to any other track by inserting Q-Clone and selecting the captured curve.
- Use Tune LT to correct the pitch and intonation of vocal or instrumental tracks. Tune LT is a simplified version of Waves Tune that offers basic pitch correction and editing features. You can use Tune LT in real time or offline mode. In real time mode, you can adjust the speed, accuracy, and range of the pitch correction, as well as the amount of vibrato and formant preservation. In offline mode, you can edit the pitch curve of each note manually or automatically using the Snap to Scale option. To use Tune LT, insert it on a vocal or instrumental track and enable the plugin. You can then adjust the parameters or edit the pitch curve according to your preference.
- Use L3 Multimaximizer to optimize the loudness and dynamics of your mixes or masters. L3 Multimaximizer is a multiband limiter that lets you control the level and frequency balance of your audio. You can use L3 Multimaximizer to increase the perceived loudness of your tracks without compromising their clarity or punch. You can also use L3 Multimaximizer to shape the tone and character of your audio by adjusting the threshold, gain, release, and shape of each frequency band. To use L3 Multimaximizer, insert it on a mix or master bus and enable the plugin. You can then choose a preset or customize the settings according to your desired loudness and sound quality.
